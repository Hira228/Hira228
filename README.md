## About

In 2023, I decided to take my life into new hands and went to School 21, an educational project from Sber for developers. This decision was a key moment in my personal and professional growth. Although I had no previous experience in programming, I was ready for a new challenge and determined to explore this fascinating field.

At School 21, I was surrounded by a quality educational environment and opportunities for self-development. The curriculum provided me not only with fundamental programming knowledge, but also stimulated my creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. Through intensive immersion in the world of coding, I quickly gained confidence and passion for the activity.

Upon entering School 21, I realized that this choice was perfect for me. My passion for coding became the foundation for my personal and professional growth. Although I had no experience in this field up to that point, I am proud of my accomplishments and continue to strive for excellence in the world of technology.

## I am currently a student at School 21.
